# DnD-Helper-App
Java Spring web app for a DM's Helper App for D&amp;D 5e

Note: As I don't want to provide public access to my database, the Treasure generator and NPC inventories will not work. In a future update I might add the SQL create statements and database structure.

I am not affiliated with Wizards of the Coast or Dungeons and Dragons 5e in any way. All inspiration for this project is credited to them as well as all features for npc stats, spells, creatures, and treasure.

The xml files for all the spells, creatures, and treasure/items are included and were found in one of Ceryliae's repositories here: https://github.com/ceryliae/DnDAppFiles
